In order to run integration tests it is required the following:
1) sphinx installed in the system and path to ${sphinx_dir}/bin directory added to the PATH variable.
If you have running instance of shpinx daemon, you need to stop it before running integration tests
2) mysql instance is up and running. Root password needs to be specified in the srvlog-sql/functions.sh,
in the SRVLOG_DB_ROOT_PASSWORD environment variable. Otherwise default root password is used.
3) for cygwin users it is required to install tput plugin and add environment variable SHELLOPTS=igncr (to properly handle \r characters)
4) When running tests using maven you should specify profile "integration-test", i.e. mvn clean test -P integration-test
